## How to use

This add-on requires configuration for knowing where to fetch the lux data from:

1. Click on the "Configuration" tab.
2. Type in the entity ID of the lux sensor into the `sensor_entity_id` field.
3. Click the "SAVE" button.

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```yaml
sensor_entity_id: "sensor.lux"
```

### Option: `sensor_entity_id` (required)

Set it to the `entity_id` of the lux sensor you want to use for adapting monitor brightness.

## Lunar app configuration

For Lunar to be able to find this sensor, a few settings need to be changed from the command-line.

There are three settings that affect where Lunar looks for the sensor:

- `sensorHostname` set by default to `lunarsensor.local`
- `sensorPort` set by default to `80`
- `sensorPathPrefix` set by default to `/`

To have Lunar connect to this addon, run the following commands on your Mac running Lunar:

```sh
defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar sensorHostname homeassistant.local
defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar sensorPort 8899
```

*Note: change the port and host values if you configured them differently*

## Troubleshooting

* Check if one-shot lux reading works

```sh
‚ùØ curl homeassistant.local:8899/sensor/ambient_light

{"id":"sensor-ambient_light", "state":"0 lx", "value":0.000000}
```

* Check if the EventSource is sending lux values every 2 seconds

```sh
‚ùØ curl -N homeassistant.local:8899/events

event: state
data: {"id": "sensor-ambient_light", "state": "400.0 lx", "value": 400.0}

event: state
data: {"id": "sensor-ambient_light", "state": "400.0 lx", "value": 400.0}

event: state
data: {"id": "sensor-ambient_light", "state": "400.0 lx", "value": 400.0}
```
